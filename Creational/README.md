# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

* [**Factory Method**](./FactoryMethod/)

  ![factory-method.png](./img/factory-method.png)

  Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

* [**Abstract Factory**](./AbstractFactory/)

  Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

* [**Builder**](./Builder/)

  ![builder.png](./img/builder.png)

  Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

* [**Prototype**](./Prototype/)

  Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

* [**Singleton**](./Singleton/)

  Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
