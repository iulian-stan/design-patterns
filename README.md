# Design Patterns

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

# Classification

All patterns can be categorized by their *intent*, or purpose. This repo showcases three main groups of patterns:

* [**Creational patterns**](./Creational/) provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

* [**Structural patterns**](./Structural/) explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

* [**Behavioral patterns**](./Behavioral/) take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
